Ajax refuse to rule out <lname>Jol</lname> move

Ajax have refused to reveal whether Tottenham's boss <name>Martin Jol</name> is on the Dutch champions' shortlist to become the Amsterdam club's new coach.

<lname>Jol</lname>, who has coached in his native Holland, has guided Spurs to the Premiership's top eight. An Ajax spokesman told BBC Sport: "The coach must fit our profile - a coach who understands the Dutch league and offensive and distinctive football. "We need to find a solution soon, so someone is in place for next season." <name>Ronald Koeman</name> quit as Ajax boss last week after their exit from the Uefa Cup. <lname>Jol</lname> has been linked with the vacant post at Ajax, with reports saying he has fallen out with Spurs' sporting director <name>Frank Arnesen</name>. But in a statement on Spurs' website, <lname>Jol</lname> said: "I'm happy here, I'm not in discussion with anyone else, I don't want to go elsewhere." Ajax have enlisted the help of Dutch legend <name>Johann Cruyff</name>, currently a consultant at Barcelona, to help find a new head coach. <lname>Cruyff</lname> has admitted he has been impressed by the way former RFC Waalwijk coach <lname>Jol</lname> has turned round Spurs' fortunes since taking over from <name>Jacques Santini</name>. <name>Tonny Bruins Slot</name> and <name>Ruud Krol</name> are currently in charge of Ajax, who are third in the Dutch league.
