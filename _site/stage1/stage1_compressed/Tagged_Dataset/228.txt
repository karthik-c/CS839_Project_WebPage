<lname>Houllier</lname> praises <lname>Benitez</lname> regime

Former Liverpool manager <name>Gerard Houllier</name> has praised the work of his Anfield successor <name>Rafael Benitez</name>.

<lname>Houllier</lname> was angry at reports that he has been critical of <lname>Benitez</lname> since the Spaniard took over at Liverpool. But <lname>Houllier</lname> told BBC Sport: "In private and in public, I have stressed I believe <fname>Rafa</fname> is doing a good job. He is the right man at the right place. "<fname>Rafa</fname> is a good coach and a good man. I've spoken to him since he has been at Liverpool and never criticised him." <lname>Houllier</lname> also revealed he is now ready to return to the game after leaving Liverpool in May following six years at Anfield.

The former France boss has been linked with a host of jobs and pulled out of the race to succeed <name>Mark Hughes</name> as Wales national coach. He has been working for Uefa, covering the Premiership for French television and also coaching in Brazil with national coach <name>Alberto Perreira</name>. <lname>Houllier</lname> said: "If a good club comes up at the right time then yes, I am ready to come back. "It has been interesting to watch games from a different perspective and I have learned things. "I have been involved in football since leaving Liverpool and my batteries are recharged."

<lname>Houllier</lname> has been impressed with the quality in the Premiership after watching as a pundit - particularly with <name>Jose Mourinho</name>'s work at leaders Chelsea. He said: "Chelsea are doing very well. They have some very good creative players in <name>Damien Duff</name> and <name>Arjen Robben</name> and <name>Didier Drogba</name> showed he can change the face of a game when he came on against Newcastle. "They have got a good team spirit and are strong mentally. They have shown they can cope with all the pressure put on them because of the expectations and cope well with Jose's principles. "<fname>Jose</fname> had results before he came to Chelsea and I think he will have an impact in the Premiership because he manages his team very cleverly." And <lname>Houllier</lname>, away from his brief at Liverpool, has been hugely impressed with the Premiership. He said: "It is a very exciting league. It is entertaining, goals are scored and teams are always trying to win. "It has been very interesting to watch the game from a different perspective. "Games switch from end-to-end and there is more pace to the Premiership than other leagues. It is a very good product."
