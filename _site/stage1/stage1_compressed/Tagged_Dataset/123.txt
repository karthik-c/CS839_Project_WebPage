England's defensive crisis grows

England's defensive worries have deepened following the withdrawal of Tottenham's <name>Ledley King</name> from the squad to face Holland.

Chelsea's <name>John Terry</name> and <name>Wayne Bridge</name> are also out, leaving coach <name>Sven-Goran Eriksson</name> with a real problem for Wednesday's match at Villa Park. Injured <name>Rio Ferdinand</name> and <name>Sol Campbell</name> were both left out of the squad, and <name>Matthew Upson</name> has already pulled out. <name>Wes Brown</name> and <name>Jamie Carragher</name> are likely to be the makeshift partnership. <lname>Terry</lname>, the captain of Chelsea as they push for the Premiership title, would have been a certain starter in the absence of <lname>Campbell</lname> and <lname>Ferdinand</lname>. But now he has pulled out with a bruised knee and is likely to be replaced by <lname>Carragher</lname>, alongside <lname>Brown</lname>.

Manchester United's <lname>Brown</lname> last played for England in the defeat by Australia at Upton Park in February 2003. The 25-year-old was only called into the squad on Sunday night as cover following the enforced withdrawal of <lname>Upson</lname>, who has a hamstring injury. And <lname>Brown</lname> now looks certain to add to his tally of seven senior appearances for England. <lname>King</lname> was forced to pull out after his groin injury was assessed by England's medical staff. <lname>Eriksson</lname> has still not decided whether to call up any further back-up, having already summoned <name>Phil Neville</name> after <lname>Bridge</lname> pulled out with a foot injury.
