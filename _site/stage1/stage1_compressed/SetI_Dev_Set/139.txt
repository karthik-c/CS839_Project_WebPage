Chelsea denied by <lname>James</lname> heroics

A brave defensive display, led by keeper <name>David James</name>, helped Manchester City hold the leaders Chelsea.

After a quiet opening, <lname>James</lname> denied <name>Damien Duff</name>, <name>Jiri Jarosik</name> and <name>Mateja Kezman</name>, while <name>Paul Bosvelt</name> cleared <name>William Gallas</name>' header off the line. <name>Robbie Fowler</name> should have scored for the visitors but sent his header wide. Chelsea had most of the possession in the second half but <lname>James</lname> kept out <name>Frank Lampard</name>'s free-kick and superbly tipped the same player's volley wide. City went into the game with the proud record of being the only domestic team to beat Chelsea this season. And there was little to alarm them in the first 30 minutes as Chelsea - deprived of <name>Arjen Robben</name> and <name>Didier Drogba</name> through injury - struggled to pose much of a threat. Indeed, it was the visitors who looked likelier to enliven a drab opening played at a lethargic pace. <name>Shaun Wright-Phillips</name> - watched by England boss <name>Sven-Goran Eriksson</name> - showed his customary trickery to burst into the right of the area and deliver a dangerous ball, which was blocked by <name>John Terry</name>. But Chelsea suddenly stepped up a gear and created a flurry of chances. First, <lname>Duff</lname> got round <name>Ben Thatcher</name> and blasted in a shot that <lname>James</lname> parried to <lname>Kezman</lname>, who turned the ball wide.

Soon afterwards, <lname>Jarosik</lname> found space in the area to powerfully head <lname>Lampard</lname>'s corner goalwards but <lname>James</lname> tipped the ball over. Chelsea were now looking more like Premiership leaders and <lname>James</lname> kept out <lname>Kezman</lname>'s fierce drive before <lname>Bosvelt</lname> and <lname>James</lname> combined to clear <lname>Gallas</lname>' header from <lname>Duff</lname>'s corner. City broke swiftly up the field and the last chance of a frenetic spell should have resulted in <lname>Fowler</lname> celebrating his 150th Premiership goal. <name>Wright-Phillips</name> raced down the left and crossed to <lname>Fowler</lname> but City's lone man up front, left free by <lname>Terry</lname>'s slip, contrived to head wide when it seemed a breakthrough was certain. The second half started as quietly as the first, although <lname>James</lname> was forced to divert a cross from the lively <lname>Duff</lname> away from <lname>Eidur Gudjohnsen</lname>'s path. There was a nasty moment for <name>Petr Cech</name>, looking for a ninth straight clean sheet in the league, when a series of ricochets saw <lname>Fowler</lname> chase a loose ball in the area and collide accidently with the Czech Republic stopper. Another quiet spell followed, which <lname>Duff</lname> interrupted with a surging run that was halted illegally on the edge of the penalty area by <lname>Bosvelt</lname>. <lname>Lampard</lname> stepped up to blast a shot through the wall and <lname>James</lname> somehow blocked it with his legs. Another timely challenge, this time from <name>Richard Dunne</name> in time added on, prevented <lname>Gudjohnsen</lname> from getting in a shot. There was still time for <lname>James</lname> to produce a sensational save to tip <lname>Lampard</lname>'s volley round the post.
