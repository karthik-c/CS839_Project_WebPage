London Irish 19-33 Wasps

Wasps made light of the absence of several internationals to sink London Irish with a trio of second-half tries.

<name>Rob Hoadley</name> returned to haunt his old club at the Madejski Stadium, scoring the opening try in the 43rd minute. <name>Tom Voyce</name> powered through the Irish defence for Wasps' second try before <name>Richard Birkett</name> went over unchallenged. <name>Mark van Gisbergen</name> added 18 points. Irish replied with three penalties and a <name>Mark Mapletoft</name> drop goal before <name>Scott Staniforth</name> ran in a consolation try. <name>Barry Everitt</name>, who replaced <lname>Mapletoft</lname> late in the game, added the conversion to become the fourth Premiership player to reach 1,000 points. He joins <name>Jonny Wilkinson</name>, <name>Tim Stimpson</name> and <name>Paul Grayson</name> in achieving that target. Wasps piled on the pressure in an attempt to grab a fourth try which would have secured them a bonus point, but they were denied by some desperate defending from Irish. Director of rugby <name>Warren Gatland</name> revealed that harsh words at half-time inspired his Wasps side to raise their game after the restart.

"They got a roasting and it was a good second-half performance when they came out and played to instructions," he said. <lname>Gatland</lname> also singled out stand-in flankers <name>Tom Rees</name> and <name>John Hart</name> for special praise. "They did very well. The back row played some fantastic rugby," he added. London Irish coach <name>Gary Gold</name> felt the result exposed his side's lack of consistency.

Irish trailed by just two points at the break and <lname>Gold</lname> said: "For 55 minutes we lived with the best but we have got to get back for the full 80 minutes." <lname>Gold</lname> will now turn his attention to next week's Powergen Cup semi-final at struggling Leeds. "We've got a good chance but with Leeds facing possible relegation they're going to come out firing," he added.
