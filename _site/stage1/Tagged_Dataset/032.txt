<lname>Bekele</lname> sets sights on world mark

Olympic 10,000m champion <name>Kenenisa Bekele</name> is determined to add the world indoor two mile record at February's Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham.

The 22-year-old will again be chasing a record held by his compatriot and mentor <name>Haile Gebrselassie</name>, who set the mark at the same meeting in 2003. "I am still as hungry to do as much as I can in this sport," said <lname>Bekele</lname>. "And aiming for the two mile world record in Birmingham is the next of those targets." <lname>Gebrselassie</lname>'s current record stands at eight minutes, 04.69 seconds. And <lname>Bekele</lname> is no stranger to overhauling world marks at the National Indoor Arena. The Ethiopian broke the world indoor 5,000m record on his debut at the meeting last year. Compatriots <name>Mulugeta Wondimu</name>, <name>Abiyote Abate</name> and <name>Markos Geneti</name>, the world indoor bronze medallist over 3000m, will race against <lname>Bekele</lname> on 18 February. The meet has already attracted a crop of Olympic talent. Britain's 800m and 1500m champion <name>Kelly Holmes</name> is taking part in the 1000m. Swedish heptathlon gold medallist <name>Carolina Kluft</name> will contest the 60m hurdles.
