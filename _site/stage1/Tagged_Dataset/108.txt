Clyde 0-5 Celtic

Celtic brushed aside Clyde to secure their place in the Scottish Cup semi-final, but only after a nervy and testing first half.

The home side's <name>Craig Bryson</name> had a goal chopped off before <name>Stan Varga</name> headed Celtic into the lead. <name>Alan Thompson</name> scored from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after <name>Shaun Maloney</name> had been fouled. <name>Stilian Petrov</name> slid in a third, <lname>Varga</lname> tapped in his second and <name>Craig Bellamy</name> completed the rout with a fine drive. <name>Bryn Halliwell</name> was the busier keeper early on, saving from <lname>Bellamy</lname>, <name>Chris Sutton</name> and <lname>Juninho</lname>. Clyde had the ball in the net after half-an-hour through a tremendous strike from <lname>Bryson</lname>, but the referee had already blown for a foul by <lname>Petrov</lname>. From the resulting free kick, <name>Darren Sheridan</name> curled the ball round the Celtic wall only for the post to deny him. Back at the other end, <lname>Halliwell</lname> did well to come off his line and block <lname>Bellamy</lname>'s effort to lift the ball over him. The keeper misjudged a corner that <name>Stephane Henchoz</name> headed wide, but a similar scenario five minutes before the break led to the opening goal. The ball was delivered from the left and <lname>Halliwell</lname> was left floundering as <lname>Varga</lname> glanced the ball into the net.

<lname>Maloney</lname> replaced the injured <lname>Sutton</lname> at half time and he marked his first competitive appearance after a year out injured by helping his side take a two-goal lead just after the break. The young striker fired a free kick straight into the Clyde wall but as he collected the rebound, he was tripped by <lname>Bryson</lname> and <lname>Thompson</lname> converted the penalty. <lname>Sheridan</lname> and <lname>Bellamy</lname> were involved in something of a flare-up that led to both being booked after the intervention of the assistant referee. <lname>Juninho</lname> brought out another good save from <lname>Halliwell</lname> and then <lname>Petrov</lname> saw a tremendous effort come off the top of the bar. But <lname>Petrov</lname> and <lname>Juninho</lname> combined brilliantly to allow the Bulgarian to make it 3-0 on the hour mark - a quick one-two giving him the time and space to steer the ball past <lname>Halliwell</lname> from 12 yards. <lname>Varga</lname> got his second goal of the game as Celtic drove home their advantage - <lname>Thompson</lname> whipped in a corner from the right and the unmarked defender simply tapped the ball over the line from a couple of yards out. Celtic were utterly dominant by this stage and <lname>Bellamy</lname> opened his scoring account for the club after a fine move involving <name>Aiden McGeady</name>, <name>Jackie McNamara</name> and <lname>Maloney</lname> culminated in the Welshman hammering the ball into the net. <lname>Halliwell</lname> kept the deficit at five by pushing a <lname>McGeady</lname> shot wide as the game petered out.
