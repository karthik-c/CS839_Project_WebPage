Reds sink 10-man Magpies

<name>Titus Bramble</name>'s own goal put Liverpool on the comeback trail as injury-hit Newcastle were well beaten at Anfield.

<name>Patrick Kluivert</name>'s close-range finish put Newcastle ahead after 31 minutes, but they were pegged back as <lname>Bramble</lname> headed in <name>Steven Gerrard</name>'s corner. <name>Neil Mellor</name> gave Liverpool the lead before half-time from <name>Milan Baros</name>' pass before the Czech added a third after rounding Shay Given on the hour. Newcastle then had <name>Lee Bowyer</name> sent off for two bookable offences. Liverpool brought back <name>Luis Garcia</name> after a hamstring injury, while Newcastle were forced to draft in Kluivert after <name>Craig Bellamy</name> was a late withdrawal with a back injury sustained in the warm-up. And <lname>Garcia</lname> should have crowned his return with a goal inside the opening minute when he took a pass from <lname>Baros</lname> but shot wildly over the top from eight yards. <name>Olivier Bernard</name> was only inches away from giving Newcastle the lead after 20 minutes, when he fired just wide from a free-kick 25 yards out. But <lname>Souness</lname>'s side did go ahead 11 minutes later in highly controversial circumstances.

<lname>Kluivert</lname> looked suspiciously offside when <name>Kieron Dyer</name> set <lname>Bowyer</lname> free, but the Dutchman was then perfectly placed to score from six yards. The lead lasted three minutes, with Liverpool back on terms as Bramble headed <lname>Gerrard</lname>'s corner into his own net under pressure from <name>Sami Hyypia</name>. And Liverpool were ahead after 37 minutes when <lname>Baros</lname> slid a perfect pass into <lname>Mellor</lname>'s path for the youngster to slip a slide-rule finish into <lname>Given</lname>'s bottom corner. <lname>Garcia</lname>'s finishing was wayward, and he was wasteful again in first-half injury time, shooting tamely at <lname>Given</lname> after good work by <name>Xabi Alonso</name>. Any hopes of a Newcastle recovery looked to be snuffed out on the hour when a brilliant turn and pass by <name>Harry Kewell</name> set <lname>Baros</lname> free and he rounded <lname>Given</lname> to score. <name>Jermaine Jenas</name> then missed a glorious chance to throw Newcastle a lifeline, shooting over from just eight yards out from Shola Ameobi's cross. Then Bowyer, who had already been booked for a foul on <lname>Alonso</lname>, was deservedly shown the red card by referee <name>Graham Poll</name> for a wild challenge on Liverpool substitute <name>Florent Sinama-Pongolle</name>.
