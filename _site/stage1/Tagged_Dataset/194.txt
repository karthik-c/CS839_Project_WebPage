"If <fname>Jens</fname> is not Arsenal's number one keeper, that is a problem for me. He must be playing regularly." <lname>Lehmann</lname> is desperate to keep his place in the Germany squad when the country hosts the World Cup in 2006. <lname>Klinsmann</lname> added: "If he is not playing regularly he cannot be Germany's number one keeper, or even number two keeper. "The situation for <fname>Jens</fname> is that he is currently the number two keeper at Arsenal. This could be critical if it remains the same during next season."
