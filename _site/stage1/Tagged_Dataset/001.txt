<lname>Claxton</lname> hunting first major medal

British hurdler <name>Sarah Claxton</name> is confident she can win her first major medal at next month's European Indoor Championships in Madrid.

The 25-year-old has already smashed the British record over 60m hurdles twice this season, setting a new mark of 7.96 seconds to win the AAAs title. "I am quite confident," said <lname>Claxton</lname>. "But I take each race as it comes. "As long as I keep up my training but not do too much I think there is a chance of a medal." <lname>Claxton</lname> has won the national 60m hurdles title for the past three years but has struggled to translate her domestic success to the international stage. Now, the Scotland-born athlete owns the equal fifth-fastest time in the world this year. And at last week's Birmingham Grand Prix, <lname>Claxton</lname> left European medal favourite Russian <name>Irina Shevchenko</name> trailing in sixth spot.

For the first time, <lname>Claxton</lname> has only been preparing for a campaign over the hurdles - which could explain her leap in form. In previous seasons, the 25-year-old also contested the long jump but since moving from Colchester to London she has re-focused her attentions. <lname>Claxton</lname> will see if her new training regime pays dividends at the European Indoors which take place on 5-6 March.
