<lname>Brizzel</lname> to run AAA's in Sheffield

Ballymena sprinter <name>Paul Brizzel</name> will be among eight of Ireland's European Indoor hopefuls competing in this weekend's AAA's Championships.

US-based <name>Alistair Cragg</name> and <name>Mark Carroll</name> are the only Irish athletes selected so far for the Europeans who will not run in Sheffield. <lname>Brizzel</lname> will defend his 200m title in the British trials. In-form <name>James McIlroy</name> will hope to confirm his place in the British team for Madrid by winning the 800m title. <lname>McIlroy</lname> has been in tremendous form on the European circuit in recent weeks. He is one of the fastest 800m runners in the world this winter and already seems assured of a place in Madrid. Corkman <name>Mark Carroll</name> confirmed in midweek that he would join <lname>Cragg</lname> in the European Championships. <lname>Carroll</lname> is ranked number three in the world 3000m ranking at the moment with <lname>Cragg</lname> occupying top spot. Meanwhile, nine-times champion <name>Dermot Donnelly</name> will not be coming out of retirement to compete in the Northern Ireland Cross Country Championships in Coleraine on Saturday. An injury crisis in the <name>Annadale Striders</name> squad led to <lname>Donnelly</lname> being entered by coach <name>John McLaughlin</name> but the athlete told BBC Sport on Friday evening that he would not be running. Willowfield's <name>Paul Rowan</name> will go in as individual favourite but <lname>Annadale</lname> could have a tough job holding on to their team title as <name>Andrew Dunwoody</name> and <name>Noel Pollock</name> are unlikely to run.
