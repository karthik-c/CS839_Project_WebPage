Barcelona title hopes hit by loss

Barcelona's pursuit of the Spanish title took a blow on Sunday as they fell to a 2-0 defeat at home to Atletico Madrid.

<name>Fernando Torres</name> gave Athletico an ideal start with a goal in the first minute. <fname>Ronaldino</fname> wasted a second-half chance to equalise for Barca when he put a penalty wide, but <lname>Torres</lname> made no such mistake with a last-minute spot-kick. The defeat, coupled with Real Madrid's 4-0 win over Espanyol on Saturday, reduces Barca's lead to four points. Former Everton midfielder <name>Thomas Gravesen</name> scored his first goal for Real in the comfortable victory at the Bernabeu. <name>Zinedine Zidane</name> had opened the scoring before <fname>Raul</fname> bagged a brace. <lname>Gravesen</lname>, who replaced <lname>Zidane</lname>, completed the scoring in the 84th minute with a low shot. <name>David Beckham</name>, watched by <name>Sven-Goran Eriksson</name>, came off in the 67th minute with a shoulder injury but should be fit for England's game against Holland. England team-mate <name>Michael Owen</name> came on for <fname>Raul</fname> after 76 minutes with the game already won. Real have now won six consecutive Primera Liga games since coach <name>Wanderley Luxemburgo</name> took charge.
