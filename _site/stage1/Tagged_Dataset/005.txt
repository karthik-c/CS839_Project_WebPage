Dibaba breaks 5,000m world record

Ethiopia's <name>Tirunesh Dibaba</name> set a new world record in winning the women's 5,000m at the Boston Indoor Games.

<lname>Dibaba</lname> won in 14 minutes 32.93 seconds to erase the previous world indoor mark of 14:39.29 set by another Ethiopian, <name>Berhane Adera</name>, in Stuttgart last year. But compatriot <name>Kenenisa Bekele's</name> record hopes were dashed when he miscounted his laps in the men's 3,000m and staged his sprint finish a lap too soon. Ireland's <name>Alistair Cragg</name> won in 7:39.89 as <lname>Bekele</lname> battled to second in 7:41.42. "I didn't want to sit back and get out-kicked," said <lname>Cragg</lname>. "So I kept on the pace. The plan was to go with 500m to go no matter what, but when <lname>Bekele</lname> made the mistake that was it. The race was mine." Sweden's <name>Carolina Kluft</name>, the Olympic heptathlon champion, and Slovenia's <name>Jolanda Ceplak</name> had winning performances, too. <lname>Kluft</lname> took the long jump at 6.63m, while <lname>Ceplak</lname> easily won the women's 800m in 2:01.52.
