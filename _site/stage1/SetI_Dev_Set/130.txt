<lname>Weir</lname> poised for Sunderland move

Larne's teenage star <name>Robbie Weir</name> is poised to join Sunderland after turning down a move to Stoke City.

The 17-year-old Irish League midfielder was also being chased by Rangers and Fulham, but <name>Mick McCarthy</name>'s side appear to have won the race. But Larne boss <name>Jimmy McGeough</name> has yet to confirm that <lname>Weir</lname> is on his way from Inver Park. "I heard on Sunday that he has joined Sunderland, but not from the lad himself," he said. ''<fname>Robbie</fname> has an agreement with Larne that he can negotiate with interested clubs.

''Personally, I would rather see him making an impact at local level to build up his physique before moving into the full-time game. ''He has been on trial with a number of clubs. But it would be great to see him making it at Sunderland.''
