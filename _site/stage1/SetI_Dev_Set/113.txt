<lname>Wright-Phillips</lname> to start on right

England coach <name>Sven-Goran Eriksson</name> has revealed <name>Shaun Wright-Phillips</name> will start against the Netherlands.

But <lname>Wright-Phillips</lname> will not make his first start for England playing on the left, as had been widely expected. "<name>Shaun Wright-Phillips</name> will probably start the game," said <lname>Eriksson</lname>. "But I'm not going to start <lname>Wright-Phillips</lname> on the left." <lname>Eriksson</lname> also revealed that <name>Wes Brown</name> will start alongside <name>Jamie Carragher</name> in the injury-hit centre of defence. When asked if <lname>Brown</lname> and <lname>Carragher</lname> would start <lname>Eriksson</lname> replied: "I could tell you yes. "It's a blow that four or five central defenders are away because of injuries. "On the other hand it's good for <lname>Carragher</lname> and <lname>Brown</lname> to show what they can do at this level. That's positive." The England coach said that he had been impressed by <lname>Wright-Phillips</lname>' form for Manchester City. "He deserves his chance. He has been playing well all season and I look forward to seeing him." And he added that <name>Andy Johnson</name> and <name>Stewart Downing</name> - the other two new players in the squad - would also get a chance to impress. "<lname>Wright-Phillips</lname>, <lname>Downing</lname> and <lname>Johnson</lname> will start or get the chance to play some part. "<lname>Johnson</lname> was not in my plans a year ago but he is doing a great season and scoring a lot of goals. "<lname>Downing</lname> is another one making a great season. He is young, talented and there are not too many left-footed players in the squad."
