Newcastle 27-27 Gloucester

Newcastle centre <name>Mathew Tait</name> answered his critics as he scored one try and made another, but he could not stop Gloucester grabbing a draw.

The Falcons were 22-6 down at the break before <lname>Tait</lname>, recently axed by England after just one Six Nations outing, inspired his side to a 27-22 lead. A last-gasp touchdown from Luke Narraway pulled the visitors level. But Gloucester missed out on victory when <name>Henry Paul</name> fluffed the conversion and <name>Seti Kiole</name> was denied a late try. Newcastle had a couple of chances at the start of the second half with line-outs in the corner. But they failed to make them count until <name>Joe Shaw</name> found <name>Dave Walder</name>, who released <name>Mark Mayerholfer</name> in his own 22.

The former All Black broke clear and popped the ball up for <lname>Tait</lname> on halfway. He chipped ahead for <name>Michael Stephenson</name> to scorch through for the try, which Walder converted to give Newcastle a lifeline. They grabbed it with both hands, <lname>Mayerhofler</lname> breaking through and <lname>Tait</lname> making a brilliant early run to cut inside and race 30m to score. <lname>Walder</lname> converted to make it 22-20 before he was just wide with a 40m penalty in the 70th minute.

<lname>Mayerhofler</lname> then scythed through the middle for a try after <name>Hall Charlton</name> popped the ball up, and <lname>Walder</lname>'s conversion took Newcastle 27-22 ahead. With three minutes of normal time left, <lname>Narraway</lname> was driven over for a try in the corner which levelled the scores at 27-27. <lname>Henry</lname> missed the conversion but Gloucester nearly won it when <lname>Kiole</lname> broke through only to be hauled down by <lname>Charlton</lname> and <name>Tom May</name>.
