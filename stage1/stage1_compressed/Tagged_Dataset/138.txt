<lname>Bellamy</lname> under new fire

Newcastle boss <name>Graeme Souness</name> has reopened his dispute with <name>Craig Bellamy</name> after claiming the Welshman was "not good enough" for the Magpies. <lname>Bellamy</lname> left Newcastle to join Celtic on loan after a major row with <lname>Souness</lname>. <lname>Souness</lname> - who refused to refer to the 25-year-old by name - said <lname>Bellamy</lname> did not score enough goals "The chap that's just gone has scored 9.3 goals a season in his time in senior football - half of those weren't even in the top flight," said <lname>Souness</lname>. "That's not good enough for a striker at a club like this. "We need to have two strikers who are near 20 goals on a regular basis."

<lname>Bellamy</lname> turned down a move to Birmingham in favour of joining Celtic after a disagreement about the Welsh international playing out of position quickly escalated. Earlier in the week, <lname>Souness</lname> had said that he risked losing the confidence of the players and damaging his own reputation if he had not taken a hard line after <lname>Bellamy</lname> accused him of lying.

"There are certain things you can forgive and forget," said <lname>Souness</lname>. "But if I'd been seen to be weak in this case there was no future for me with the players in the dressing room or any job I have after Newcastle." He could then return to St James' Park - and he says that he wants to. However, it would seem unlikely he will play for Newcastle again as long as <lname>Souness</lname> remains in charge.
