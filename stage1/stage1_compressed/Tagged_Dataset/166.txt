<lname>Prutton</lname> poised for lengthy FA ban

Southampton's <name>David Prutton</name> faces a possible seven-match ban when he goes before the Football Association.

The 23-year-old has admitted two charges of improper conduct following his dismissal against Arsenal. The first charge relates to his failure to leave the field promptly, pushing referee <name>Alan Wiley</name> and remonstrating with assistant referee <name>Paul Norman</name>. And the second charge is for using threatening words and/or behaviour to a match official during the 1-1 draw.

<name>Paolo di Canio</name> was given a seven-match suspension when he pushed referee <name>Paul Alcock</name> over in a Premiership game between Sheffield Wednesday and Arsenal in 1998. <lname>Prutton</lname> will be joined at Wednesday's hearing by Saints boss <name>Harry Redknapp</name>, who believes that the FA will throw the book at his player. <lname>Redknapp</lname> himself sprinted along the touchline to help physio <name>Jim Joyce</name> and coach <name>Denis Rofe</name> shepherd the enraged <lname>Prutton</lname> away from referee's assistant <lname>Norman</lname>. "<fname>David</fname> has made a big mistake and he knows it. I can't condone what he's done. He was out of order but he knows that," said <lname>Redknapp</lname>. "He's a decent lad. He over-reacted badly for some reason - he had a rush of blood from somewhere. Off the pitch you couldn't meet a nicer lad." <lname>Prutton</lname> has apologised publicly for his actions and to Arsenal's <name>Robert Pires</name>, who was injured in a wild tackle by the Saints' midfield man.

He said: "It's an horrendous situation. I apologise to the ref and linesman, who were only doing their job. "I've also seen what happened to <lname>Pires</lname>' leg and I'm sorry for that as well." "I apologise for the people who saw it. I know you get lots of kids going to the match now and they don't pay money to see that sort of thing. "It's not a cop-out, but it was all a bit of a blur. Sometimes you react and it's beyond your control, " added <lname>Prutton</lname>.
