Chelsea clinch cup in extra-time

(after extra-time - score at 90 mins 1-1)

<name>John Arne Riise</name> volleyed Liverpool ahead after 45 seconds but <name>Steven Gerrard</name> scored a 79th-minute own goal. Blues boss <name>Jose Mourinho</name> was sent off for taunting Liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game. <lname>Drogba</lname> and <lname>Kezman</lname> scored from close range before <name>Antonio Nunez</name>'s header made for a tense finale. It was an amazing climax which gave Mourinho his first silverware as Chelsea manager. Yet it was controversial too, after <lname>Mourinho</lname>'s sending off, apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the Liverpool fans. There was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the Reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute.

<lname>Riise</lname> could not have connected any better with <lname>Morientes</lname>' cross as he smashed a left-foot volley past <name>Petr Cech</name>. The goal, the quickest-ever in a League Cup final, stunned a Blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to Newcastle and Barcelona in the previous week. The Blues' attacking chances were limited, and <name>Jerzy Dudek</name> was equal to <name>Frank Lampard</name>'s powerfully-struck drive and <lname>Drogba</lname>'s low shot. Despite their frustration, Chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break Liverpool's well-organised defence.

<name>Joe Cole</name> had a shot blocked and a promising <name>Damien Duff</name> break was halted by a good tackle from <name>Djimi Traore</name>, but the Reds reached half-time without any major scares. The Blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged Liverpool back. Nevertheless, Liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from <lname>Dudek</lname> on 54 minutes, first at full stretch from <lname>Gudjohnsen</lname>'s header, then to smother <name>William Gallas</name>' follow-up. And despite Chelsea's possession, it was Liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as <name>Luis Garcia</name> fed <name>Dietmar Hamann</name> whose shot forced a superb save from <lname>Cech</lname>. And the Blues' increasingly adventurous approach saw Liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as <name>Paulo Ferreira</name> denied <lname>Gerrard</lname> with a last-ditch tackle. But <lname>Gerrard</lname> was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected <lname>Ferrerira</lname>'s free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring Chelsea level. That prompted <lname>Mourinho</lname>'s reaction which saw him sent off, but Chelsea still pressed and <lname>Duff</lname> had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining. <lname>Dudek</lname> saved bravely at the Irishman's feet, while <name>Milan Baros</name> shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time. <lname>Drogba</lname> almost headed Chelsea in front two minutes into extra-time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post. But seconds after the half-time interval, <lname>Drogba</lname> made no mistake, picking the ball up from <name>Glen Johnson</name>'s long throw inside the six-yard box and sidefooting home. And <lname>Kezman</lname> appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after <lname>Gudjohnsen</lname>'s cross in the 110th minute. There was still drama as <lname>Nunez</lname> beat <lname>Cech</lname> to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level, but despite Liverpool's desperate attacks, Chelsea clung on to win.
