Celtic make late bid for <lname>Bellamy</lname>

Newcastle striker <name>Craig Bellamy</name> is discussing a possible short-term loan move to Celtic, BBC Sport understands.

The Welsh striker has rejected a move to Birmingham after falling out with Magpies manager <name>Graeme Souness</name>. The Toon boss vowed <lname>Bellamy</lname> would not play again after a bitter row over his exclusion for the game against Arsenal. Celtic are in no position to match Birmingham's Â£6m offer but a stay until the end of the season could suit <lname>Bellamy</lname> while he considers his future. According to <lname>Bellamy</lname>'s agent, the player dismissed a permanent move to Birmingham. And it is unlikely that Newcastle would allow the player to go on loan to another Premiership club.

<lname>Bellamy</lname> was fined two weeks' wages after a live TV interview in which he accused <lname>Souness</lname> of lying, following a very public dispute about what position <lname>Bellamy</lname> should play in the side. <lname>Souness</lname> said: "He can't play for me ever again. He has been a disruptive influence from the minute I walked into this football club. "He can't go on television and accuse me of telling lies." Chairman <name>Freddy Shepherd</name> described <lname>Bellamy</lname>'s behaviour as "totally unacceptable and totally unprofessional".
