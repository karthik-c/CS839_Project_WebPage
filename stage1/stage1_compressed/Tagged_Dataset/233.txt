<lname>Redknapp</lname> poised for Saints

Southampton are set to unveil <name>Harry Redknapp</name> as their new manager at a news conference at 1500 GMT on Wednesday.

The former Portsmouth boss replaces <name>Steve Wigley</name>, who has been relieved of first-team duties after just one win in 14 league games in charge. <lname>Redknapp</lname>, 57, quit his Fratton Park position on 24 November and vowed: "I will not go down the road - no chance." Pompey coach <name>Kevin Bond</name> is poised to join <lname>Redknapp</lname>, who will be Saints' third boss of the season. <lname>Redknapp</lname>'s first game in charge will be at home to Middlesbrough on Saturday. Portsmouth chairman <name>Milan Mandaric</name> said he was "disappointed" by the news and claimed <lname>Redknapp</lname> had been in talks with Southampton for "some time".

"It would appear that negotiations over this have been going on for some time," <lname>Mandaric</lname> said on Portsmouth's official website. "I am surprised and a little shocked that the chairman of Southampton has not picked up the phone and kept me informed." According to <lname>Mandaric</lname>, <lname>Redknapp</lname> vowed he would not join their South coast rivals when he left Portsmouth. "I said to <fname>Harry</fname> 'I hope you don't go to Southampton', and he told me 'absolutely not'," he said. "I'm wouldn't say I'm bitter, disgusted or angry, just disappointed, but it's <fname>Harry</fname>'s life and it's his decision." <lname>Redknapp</lname> became a cult hero after leading Portsmouth into the Premiership for the first time, and then masterminding their survival in their debut season. But he left the club claiming he needed a break from football, though many believed he was upset with <lname>Mandaric</lname>'s decision to bring in <name>Velimir Zajec</name> as executive director.

Southampton chairman <name>Rupert Lowe</name> was desperate to give former academy director <lname>Wigley</lname>, who replaced <name>Paul Sturrock</name> just two games into the season, every chance to succeed at St Mary's. But results under <lname>Wigley</lname> have been poor and Southampton are deep in trouble near the foot of the table. When <lname>Redknapp</lname>'s appointment is confirmed, he will be Saints' ninth manager in eight years.
