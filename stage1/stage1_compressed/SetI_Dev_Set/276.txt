Mexicans tracking unhappy <fname>Juninho</fname>

Mexican outfit Red Sharks Veracruz hope to sign <fname>Juninho</fname> if the Brazilian decides to leave Celtic frustrated at his lack of first-team action.

Their president, <name>Gustavo Parente Sanchez</name>, says <fname>Juninho</fname> "does not wish to remain in Scottish football anymore". Agent <name>Brian Hassell</name> insists that the 31-year-old Brazilian midfielder is determined to win back his place. "But, if the manager is not going to pick him, that's a different ball game," he told The Sun. "That's something we'd have to look at. <fname>Juninho</fname> deserves respect. He is not a little kid." <lname>Hassell</lname> warns that <fname>Juninho</fname> could reconsider his future at Celtic unless he is given a run of games by the end of the January transfer window.

<fname>Juninho</fname> was signed from Middlesbrough during the summer, but he has failed to live up to high expectations and has lost his place to 18-year-old <name>Aiden McGeady</name>. "He has 50 caps for Brazil and he's the best signing Celtic ever made," insisted <lname>Hassell</lname>. "He wants to play for <name>Martin O'Neill</name>, but does <name>Martin O'Neill</name> want to play him? "<fname>Juninho</fname> is not someone who has come through the Celtic ranks. He deserves much more respect." <lname>Sanchez</lname> is bullish about his hopes of prising Juninho from the Scottish champions, although <lname>Hassell</lname> believes Mexico would not be his preferred destination. "We have already spoken with <fname>Juninho</fname> and he said, if he has no firm offer from a club in Spain, Veracruz will be his destination," <lname>Sanchez</lname> told his club's official website. Celtic manager <lname>O'Neill</lname> is no respecter of reputations. "The onus is on <fname>Juninho</fname> to force his way into the team," he said. "Players get a game on merit. That's the way it has always been and that is certainly the case at Celtic Park."
