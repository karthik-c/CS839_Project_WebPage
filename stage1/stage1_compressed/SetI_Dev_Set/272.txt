Newcastle to join <lname>Morientes</lname> race

Newcastle have joined the race to sign Real Madrid striker <name>Fernando Morientes</name> and scupper Liverpool's bid to snap up the player, according to reports.

Liverpool were reported to have bid £3.5m for the 28-year-old Spanish international this week. But the Liverpool Echo newspaper has said Anfield boss <name>Rafa Benitez</name> will avoid a bidding war and instead turn his attentions to <name>Nicolas Anelka</name>. Real are believed to still want £7m before selling <lname>Morientes</lname>. Monaco are also in the race for the player they had on loan last season. Reports suggest Liverpool will lift their offer to £5m - the highest they are willing to go before bowing out of any deal.

On Tuesday, <lname>Morientes</lname> had said: "I like Liverpool and I am pleased that a club of their stature want to buy me. I have told Madrid that I want it to happen. "Madrid know my situation and they know they must do something about me. They must sort out the situation by being sensible. "I am in a position where I want to play, and I will have to look elsewhere to do that. If Madrid do not want me then it's in the best interests of everyone that they are realistic.

"I haven't spoken to <name>Rafa Benitez</name> but I have always appreciated his work and I would like to play for him. But <lname>Benitez</lname> could yet turn his attentions to the younger <lname>Anelka</lname> should <lname>Morientes</lname> be reluctant to pledge his future to Liverpool. <lname>Anelka</lname> previously played at Anfield under <name>Gerard Houllier</name> before sealing his permanent switch to Manchester City.
