Britain's <name>Jason Gardener</name> enjoyed a double 60m success in Glasgow in his first competitive outing since he won 100m relay gold at the Athens Olympics.

<lname>Gardener</lname> cruised home ahead of Scot <name>Nick Smith</name> to win the invitational race at the Norwich Union International. He then recovered from a poor start in the second race to beat Swede <name>Daniel Persson</name> and Italy's <name>Luca Verdecchia</name>. His times of 6.61 and 6.62 seconds were well short of American <name>Maurice Greene</name>'s 60m world record of 6.39secs from 1998. "It's a very hard record to break, but I believe I've trained very well," said the world indoor champion, who hopes to get closer to the mark this season. "It was important to come out and make sure I got maximum points. My last race was the Olympic final and there was a lot of expectation. "This was just what I needed to sharpen up and get some race fitness. I'm very excited about the next couple of months."
