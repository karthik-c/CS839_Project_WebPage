<lname>Chepkemei</lname> hit by big ban

Kenya's athletics body has suspended two-time London Marathon runner-up <name>Susan Chepkemei</name> from all competition until the end of the year.

Athletics Kenya (AK) issued the ban after <lname>Chepkemei</lname> failed to turn up for a cross country training camp in Embu. "We have banned her from all local and international competitions," said AK chief <name>Isaiah Kiplagat</name>. "We shall communicate this decision to the IAAF and all meet directors all over the world." The 29-year-old finished second to <name>Paula Radcliffe</name> in the 2002 and 2003 London races, and was also edged out in an epic New York Marathon contest last year.

But the ban will prevent the two-time world half-marathon silver medallist from challenging <lname>Radcliffe</lname> at this year's London event in April. Global Sports Communications, <lname>Chepkemei</lname>'s management company, said she had wanted to run in the World Cross Country Championships in March. But AK maintained it was making an example of <lname>Chepkemei</lname> as a warning to other Kenyan athletes. "We are taking this action in order to salvage our pride," said <lname>Kiplagat</lname>. "We have been accused of having no teeth to bite with and that agents are ruling over us." KA has also threatened three-time women's short-course champion <name>Edith Masai</name> with a similar ban if reports that she feigned injury to avoid running at the cross country world championships are true. <lname>Masai</lname> missed the national trials in early February, but was included in the provisional team on the proviso that she ran in a regional competition. She failed to run in the event, citing a leg injury.
