<lname>Cole</lname> refuses to blame <lname>van Persie</lname>

<name>Ashley Cole</name> has refused to blame <name>Robin van Persie</name> for leaving Arsenal with no fully-fit strikers for the FA Cup fifth round replay at Sheffield United.

<lname>Van Persie</lname> is suspended alongside <name>Dennis Bergkamp</name> and <name>Jose Antonio Reyes</name> after being sent off at Southampton when Arsenal had a numerical advantage. <name>Thierry Henry</name> is ruled out with an Achilles tendon injury but <lname>Cole</lname> said: "No-one is putting the blame on <fname>Robin</fname>. "It's just something that happens on the spur of the moment." <lname>Cole</lname> added: "I've done it before and I hope they didn't blame me for anything. "Of course he'll learn. I've been sent off a couple of times now and it's just one of those things when you go a bit crazy for one or two seconds. <name>Freddie Ljungberg</name> is likely to be used in an emergency striking role and will be partnered by either <name>Arturo Lupoli</name>, <name>Quincy Owusu-Abeyie</name> or <name>Jeremie Aliadiere</name>. Gunners boss <name>Arsene Wenger</name> said: "<fname>Freddie</fname> is an option but we need a second striker. "I have to decide whether it will be <lname>Aliadiere</lname>, <fname>Quincy</fname> or <lname>Lupoli</lname> who will start with him up front. Those three will be involved." Arsenal are also without winger <name>Robert Pires</name>, who sustained an ankle injury at St Mary's. <lname>Wenger</lname> added: "It doesn't look like anything is fractured, but it is a good ankle sprain. "It does not look like <lname>Pires</lname> will be ready for two to three weeks."
