<lname>Souness</lname> eyes summer move for <lname>Owen</lname>

Newcastle boss <name>Graeme Souness</name> is lining up a summer move for England and Real Madrid striker <name>Michael Owen</name>.

He sees <lname>Owen</lname> as the ideal replacement for <name>Alan Shearer</name>, who is due to retire in the summer, although he hopes to persuade <lname>Shearer</lname> to carry on. "<fname>Michael</fname> is in the category of players who would excite the fans and we're monitoring him," he told BBC Newcastle. "He is a great centre-forward and only 25 but I don't think we're the only ones monitoring the situation at Real." <lname>Souness</lname> has also hinted he thinks <lname>Shearer</lname> may carry on despite his stated intent to retire at the end of the season. He believes the prospect of breaking <name>Jackie Milburn</name>'s club scoring record may influence the striker's decision.

<lname>Milburn</lname> scored 200 league and cup goals between 1946 and 1957, while <lname>Shearer</lname> currently has 187 goals to his name. "Without giving too much away, I am confident he will be here next season," said <lname>Souness</lname>. "I can't imagine him leaving without breaking <name>Jackie Milburn</name>'s scoring record." <lname>Souness</lname> also revealed he tried to bring back <name>Nolberto Solano</name> during the January transfer window. The Peruvian international was sold to Aston Villa a year ago but in the phone-in for BBC Newcastle, <lname>Souness</lname> said tried to re-sign him, but Villa were not interested in selling.

The former Rangers and Liverpool boss is also looking to bring in a number of new acquisitions once the current campaign has been completed. "I'm after three, four or five new players in the summer - we have got lots of targets," he said. "Don't think we will wait to the last day of the season to say: `Who are we going to target now?"'
