Man Utd through after Exeter test

Manchester United avoided an FA Cup upset by edging past Exeter City in their third round replay.

<name>Cristiano Ronaldo</name> scored the opener, slipping the ball between <name>Paul Jones</name>' legs after just nine minutes. United wasted a host of chances to make it safe as <lname>Jones</lname> made some great saves, but <name>Wayne Rooney</name> put the tie beyond doubt late on with a cool finish. Exeter had chances of their own, <name>Sean Devine</name> twice volleying wide and <name>Andrew Taylor</name> forcing <name>Tim Howard</name> to save. United boss Sir <name>Alex Ferguson</name> was taking few chances after their 0-0 draw in the first game and he handed starts to <name>Paul Scholes</name> and <lname>Ryan</lname> as well as <lname>Ronaldo</lname> and <lname>Rooney</lname>. Exeter began brightly with <lname>Devine</lname> and <name>Steve Flack</name> seeing plenty of the ball, but it did not take United long to assert their authority and the hosts soon found themselves a goal down. <lname>Scholes</lname> played a lovely pass in to <lname>Ronaldo</lname> on the left-hand side of the six-yard box and the Portuguese winger slid the ball between the legs of <lname>Jones</lname> to open the scoring.

United sensed a chance to finish the tie as a contest early on and <lname>Ronaldo</lname> blazed over before <lname>Jones</lname> saved well from <lname>Scholes</lname> and then <lname>Rooney</lname>. The visitors' pressure by now was incessant and <lname>Rooney</lname> had another shot blocked while <lname>Ronaldo</lname> slammed well over the bar again from a good position. Just before the break <lname>Giggs</lname> had a golden chance to double the advantage, but the Welshman dragged a left-foot effort badly wide from 10 yards. In stoppage time Exeter created their best chance as <name>Alex Jeannin</name> swung in a cross from the left that <lname>Devine</lname> managed to flick goalwards, but the ball flew wide of <lname>Howard</lname>'s goal. The Grecians came out after the break in determined fashion and <lname>Howard</lname> had to show safe hands to collect two searching crosses into the United box. <lname>Rooney</lname> looked like he might have sealed the result with a turn and shot but the ball stuck in the St James Park mud and <lname>Jones</lname> raced back to gather on the goalline. Moments later <lname>Devine</lname> had the chance to make himself a hero, but he could only volley <lname>Jeannin</lname>'s brilliant cross wide of <lname>Howard</lname>'s goal after being left unmarked six yards out. After <lname>Rooney</lname> had completely messed up a free-kick 20 yards out <lname>Taylor</lname> showed him how it should be done, his stunning drive from distance forcing a flying stop from <lname>Howard</lname>. The home crowd were baying for a goal and they did get the ball into the net only for <lname>Devine</lname>'s low effort to be ruled out for an obvious offside. The persistent <lname>Rooney</lname> eventually rounded <lname>Jones</lname> with three minutes to go and slotted into an empty net to book a home tie with Middlesbrough in the fourth round.
