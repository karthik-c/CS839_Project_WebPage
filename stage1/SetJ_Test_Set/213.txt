<lname>Jansen</lname> suffers a further setback

Blackburn striker <name>Matt Jansen</name> faces three weeks out after surgery to treat a cartilage problem.

But central defender <name>Lorenzo Amoruso</name> is moving closer to fitness following a knee operation. Rovers' assistant manager <name>Mark Bowen</name> said: "<fname>Matt</fname> had a small operation to trim knee cartilage. "It's a tiny piece of work, which should be a fairly quick recovery. <lname>Lorenzo</lname> is also jogging for the first time, along with kicking a ball." <lname>Jansen</lname>'s career has been dogged by injury since a freak scooter accident two years ago.

He returned to first-team action soon after <name>Mark Hughes</name>' appointment as Blackburn boss and marked it with a goal against Portsmouth in his first appearance of the season. <lname>Bowen</lname> added: "I'm guessing, but I reckon maybe two to three weeks before he is back in action completely." The Rovers assistant boss forecast a longer time spell for <lname>Amoruso</lname>'s availability for first-team duties. <lname>Bowen</lname> said: "There's still some scar tissue present so it will be some weeks. "It's a case of see how he goes. You can't put a real time on a comeback, we'll see how he progresses."
