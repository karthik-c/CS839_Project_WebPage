<lname>Kerr</lname> frustrated at victory margin

Republic of Ireland manager <name>Brian Kerr</name> admitted he was frustrated his side did not score more than one goal in their friendly win over Croatia.

<name>Robbie Keane</name> took his Republic record to 24 with a first-half goal which proved enough for victory. "We had more good chances. It is just a shame we did not take them against such a technically gifted team," said <lname>Kerr</lname>. "But, given the conditions and the standard of the Croatian team, we should be very happy with the win." The Republic side kept a clean sheet for the eighth time in 11 matches and are unbeaten in 14 home games since <lname>Kerr</lname> succeeded <name>Mick McCarthy</name>. <lname>Kerr</lname> applauded the decisive move which earned the victory. "It was a brilliant goal, fantastic skill by <name>Damien Duff</name>. <fname>Robbie</fname> might have scuffed it a little but it was a good goal." Matchwinner <lname>Keane</lname> was another full of praise for <lname>Duff</lname>'s role in the goal. "It was great play from <lname>Damien</lname>," said the Tottenham striker.

"I always try to be sniffing around because you know nine times out of 10 <lname>Duffer</lname> is going to get it in the box. "Playing three up was something different. <name>Brian Kerr</name> wanted to try it out and it was good to see young <name>Stephen Elliott</name> getting a run-out. "The conditions were difficult but he did well and is definitely one for the future. It is nice to see young players coming through." Man-of-the-match <lname>Duff</lname> explained what went wrong when he fluffed a chance to make it 2-0 midway through the second half. He opted to bring <name>Steve Finnan</name>'s cross down and shoot against the bar when a close-range header looked the best option. "I would have headed that every time but I completely lost it in the lights," said the Chelsea star. "I was desperate to get on the scoresheet myself but the result is the important thing. "We have had a good year and are going nicely in the qualifiers. Hopefully that can continue in 2005."
