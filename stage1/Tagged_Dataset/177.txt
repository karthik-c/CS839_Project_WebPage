<lname>Thompson</lname> says <lname>Gerrard</lname> should stay

Liverpool legend <name>Phil Thompson</name> has pleaded with <name>Steve Gerrard</name> to reject any overtures from Chelsea.

The ex-Reds assistant boss also warned that any honours won at Chelsea would be cheapened by the bid to buy success. He told BBC Radio Five Live: "Liverpool would think about any bid made but it will all be down to Steve in the end. "But it wouldn't have that same sweet feeling at Chelsea, where it's all money-orientated and about simply buying the best." <lname>Thompson</lname> reacted sharply to some Liverpool supporters, who criticised <lname>Gerrard</lname>'s performance in the Carling Cup final against Chelsea. A number of fans questioned <lname>Gerrard</lname>'s commitment and sarcastically branded his own goal in Liverpool's 3-2 defeat as his first goal for Chelsea.

<lname>Thompson</lname> added: "I heard those comments from so-called supporters and they were diabolical, absolutely outrageous. "<fname>Stevie</fname> carried the club last year and this year. He's always put Liverpool first." <lname>Thompson</lname>, who savoured seven title-winning seasons and two European Cup triumphs during his Anfield playing career, is confident that the lure of Champions League football will keep <lname>Gerrard</lname> at Anfield. "I hope Champions League football will beckon for Liverpool - either as winners or as finishing fourth in the Premiership - and he will commit himself. "There has been a lot of soul-searching the way things have gone lately. "I hope he's hardening to the fact he will have big decisions to make but I hope it is to the benefit of <name>Steven Gerrard</name> and I hope it is worthwhile for Liverpool."
