<lname>Robben</lname> sidelined with broken foot

Chelsea winger <name>Arjen Robben</name> has broken two metatarsal bones in his foot and will be out for at least six weeks.

<lname>Robben</lname> had an MRI scan on the injury, sustained during the Premiership win at Blackburn, on Monday. "Six weeks is the average time to heal this injury and then I need a few more weeks to be completely fit again," he told Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad. "I had a feeling it was serious but because of the swelling it was impossible to make a final diagnosis." The 21-year-old missed the first three months of the season with a similar injury after a challenge with Roma's <name>Olivier Dacourt</name>. And he added: "It felt different then last summer when I had the same injury on my other foot. "Then I could walk already after three days but I stayed sidelined for a long period. I hope that it will now take me six to eight weeks." Chelsea physio <name>Mike Banks</name> was hopeful that <lname>Robben</lname> could return at some point in March. "The fractures are tiny and he could be playing next month," <lname>Banks</lname> told the club's website. "One is a chip on the side of his foot, the other is a small break on the third metatarsal. "But this is not the traditional metatarsal that has become so famous since the last World Cup and which has kept <name>Scott Parker</name> out for two months."

<name>David Beckham</name> suffered a broken metatarsal in the build up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan. <lname>Robben</lname>, who has been a key part of the Blues' push for four trophies, claims he knew instantly something was wrong when he was felled by Blackburn midfielder <name>Aaron Mokoena</name>. "I felt my leg go," he said. "I felt it straight away after <lname>Mokoena</lname> hit me with a wild kick on my left foot."
