Hearts 2-1 Livingston

Hearts wrapped up their Scottish Cup quarter-final tie against Livingston with two goals in the first 10 minutes.

<name>Lee Miller</name> scored inside the opening 60 seconds, heading over <name>Colin Meldrum</name> and into the net from a <name>Jamie McAllister</name> free kick. <lname>McAllister</lname> himself scored the second when he met <name>Saul Mikoliunas</name>' cross at the back post to put the game beyond the visitors. <name>Craig Easton</name> headed in a controversial goal after an hour but Hearts held on. The opening goal came after <name>Gus Bahoken</name> had clumsily fouled <lname>Miller</lname> 35 yards from goal. <lname>McAllister</lname> floated the free kick into the Livi box and <lname>Miller</lname> outjumped the static visiting defence to loop his header from 10 yards over <lname>Meldrum</lname>. With just 10 minutes on the clock, the home side doubled their lead. <lname>Mikoliunas</lname> sprinted down the right, crossed to the back post where <lname>McAllister</lname> raced in to head past <lname>Meldrum</lname>. Moments later <lname>Miller</lname> came close to grabbing his second with a first-time drive from 16 yards, which skimmed the bar.

Then <lname>McAllister</lname> picked up a pass from <name>Stephen Simmons</name> and drove an angled shot from 20 yards narrowly past <lname>Meldrum</lname>'s far post. The impressive <lname>Mikoliunas</lname> twice went close before half time - a low drive was comfortably gathered by <lname>Meldrum</lname> and then he curled a left-footed shot past the keeper's right-hand post. Livi manager <name>Richard Gough</name> made three changes at the interval, bringing on defender <name>Goran Stanic</name>, midfielder <name>Gabor Vincze</name>, and striker <name>Ferenc Horvath</name> for <lname>Bahoken</lname>, <name>Derek Lilley</name> and <name>Mark Wilson</name>. But, in the opening stages of the second period, little changed. However, the West Lothian side gave themselves a lifeline with a controversial goal. <name>Eric Deloumeaux</name> sent <name>Jason Dair</name> away on the right and he tried to give the ball to <lname>McPake</lname>, who looked to be in an offside position. The Livi striker ignored the pass, however, and <lname>Dair</lname> ran on to it and played <lname>Easton</lname> in at the back post and he headed home from close range. The home side called for offside against <lname>McPake</lname> but referee <name>Alan Freeland</name> ignored their claims and pointed to the centre-circle. Livi went all out for the equaliser. In the 87th minute, <name>Burton O'Brien</name> was hauled back at the edge of the box by <name>Neil MacFarlane</name>, but <lname>Dair</lname> sent his shot just inches wide.
