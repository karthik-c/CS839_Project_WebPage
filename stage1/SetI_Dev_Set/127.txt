<lname>Kewell</lname> waits as injury drags on

Liverpool winger <name>Harry Kewell</name> is struggling to recover from his Achilles tendinitis problem and may not recover until March, claims his agent.

<lname>Mandic</lname> continued in the Sydney Morning Herald: "<fname>Harry</fname>'s struggling a bit but the club are doing everything they can to get him right. "<fname>Harry</fname> was desperate to be fit for the Fulham game as part of his plan to play himself in for the Leverkusen match." <lname>Kewell</lname> has not played since December 19 and misses out on international duty this week, with Australia facing South Africa in Durban on Wednesday.
