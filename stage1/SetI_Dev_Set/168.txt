<fname>Adriano</fname>'s Chelsea link rejected

<fname>Adriano</fname>'s agent <name>Gilmar Rinaldi</name> has insisted that he has had no contact with Chelsea over the striker.

Chelsea were reported to have made inquiries about Inter Milan's 22-year-old Brazilian star. <lname>Rinaldi</lname> told BBC Sport from Rio de Janeiro: "I can assure you that Chelsea have had no dealings whatsoever with either me or <fname>Adriano</fname>. "Parma and Real Madrid are interested but there's nothing new there. Their interest has been known for some time." <fname>Adriano</fname> has scored 14 goals in 20 Serie A appearances this season. And Chelsea boss <name>Jose Mourinho</name> had claimed that he was in Milan talking to <fname>Adriano</fname> on the day he is alleged to have held a clandestine meeting with Arsenal defender <name>Ashley Cole</name>. <lname>Mourinho</lname> said he was "just practising my Portuguese with him because I don't need strikers". <lname>Rinaldi</lname> told BBC Sport: "I have to say that nobody from Chelsea or any other London club has contacted me. "If they want to, that's fine. I can tell them what the situation is. "If Chelsea are interested then they must make an offer." Inter are reported to have slapped a price tag in the region of Â£40m on the head of <fname>Adriano</fname>, who joined them just over a year ago from Parma. Real Madrid view him as a natural replacement for compatriot <lname>Ronaldo</lname>. But <lname>Rinaldi</lname> said: "I cannot give you a price that Inter would accept for <fname>Adriano</fname>. That's something that would have to be negotiated between the interested clubs."
